//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirement = "Determines what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. Requirements also include defining the resources needed to build the project."

const design = "Models the way a software application will work. Some aspects of the design include: architecture, user interface, platforms, programming, communications, security. Prototyping can be a part of the design phase."

const implementation = "This is the actual writting of the program. A small project might be written by a single developer, while a large projec might be broken up and worked by several teams."

const testingAndIntegration = "Enures that each function works correctly before made available to users. Different parts of the appliction should be tested to work seamlessly together. the testing phase helps reduce the nuber of bugs and gliches that users encounter, leads to higher user satisfaction and better usage rate."

const maintain = "After deployment, the application is being used in the field. However, users might discover bugs that weren't found during testing and these errors need to be resoved. This step can involves incident resolution or management in the course of any issues or changes made to impact a customer or user base. "
